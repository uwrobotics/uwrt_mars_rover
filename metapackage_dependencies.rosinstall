# This file should contain any source dependencies that are required for this metapackage to build. If the dependency is
# available on index.ros.org, a binary dependency declared in the relevant package.xml's should be used instead.
# NOTE: local-name paths should be relative to the catkin workspace's src folder(i.e. the parent folder of this metapackage's root).

# When this file starts getting used, add it to the options (TARGET_WORKSPACE: "$TARGET_REPO_PATH metapackage_dependencies.rosinstall") of the following CI stages: arm64_build , amd64_build, clang-tidy, catkin_lint
