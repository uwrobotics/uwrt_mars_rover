[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/uwrobotics/uwrt_mars_rover.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/uwrobotics/uwrt_mars_rover)

## Repository Setup

To get started with development, clone this repo into the `src` directory of your `catkin` workspace. Use `rosinstall` and `rosdep` to fetch any source or binary dependencies.

```bash
# Ensure rosinstall and rosdep are installed and up to date
sudo apt install python-rosinstall python-rosdep
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update

# Clone repo
cd <catkin workspace location>/src
git clone https://github.com/uwrobotics/uwrt_mars_rover.git

# Install upstream source dependencies
sudo rosinstall --catkin . uwrt_mars_rover/upstream_dependencies.rosinstall

# Install metapackage source dependencies
sudo rosinstall --catkin . uwrt_mars_rover/metapackage_dependencies.rosinstall

# Install all binary dependencies
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
```

If you're setting up the repository on the Nvidia Jetson, you also need to install the arm64 upstream dependencies:
```bash
# Install upstream source dependencies for arm64
sudo rosinstall --catkin . uwrt_mars_rover/arm64_upstream_dependencies.rosinstall
```

## Updating Dependencies
Commands to update dependencies:
```bash
cd <catkin workspace location>/src
sudo rosinstall --catkin . uwrt_mars_rover/upstream_dependencies.rosinstall uwrt_mars_rover/metapackage_dependencies.rosinstall
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
```


## Adding Dependencies
For ease of setup on the Jetson, we should always try to use prebuilt binaries of dependent ROS packages, instead of 
including their sources. This means that if a package you write is dependent on a 3rd party package, you should just 
declare that dependency in the `CMakelists.txt` and `package.xml`. `rosdep` will take care of resolving the 
dependencies. 

In the event that you cannot use the binaries (ex. we rely on a feature that has not been released), the package source 
code should be cloned outside of our metapackage, so that our CI doesn't run linting/formatting checks on it. To do 
this, declare the source dependency in `upstream_dependencies.rosinstall`. If using unreleased features(ie. cloning 3rd party master branch), 
please pin the rosinstall entry to a commit hash, rather than the branch. `rosinstall` will take care of cloning the 
source dependencies declared in `upstream_dependencies.rosinstall`. 

If you need to declare dependencies that are not ROS packages, typically you can declare them as system dependencies in
a `package.xml`. If it is an unreleased source dependency, (ex. the roboteq c++ driver we wrote), declare it in the 
`metapackage_dependencies.rosinstall`. Source code modules are still subject to the clangformat and clangtidy checks 
because they should only consist of code the team has written.
